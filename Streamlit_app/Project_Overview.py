## Project Overview
st.header("Purpose of the analysis")
st.markdown("""
            The World Economic Forum states that Biodiversity is _'critically important'_ for 5 reasons, as it: ensures health and food security, helps 
            fight disease, benefits business, provides livelihood, protects us. The butterfly population has been widely studied and are thought 
            to be one of the best indicators of a healthy environment: as they have short life cycles, they have quick responses to environmental changes.

        __The purpose of this analysis is to predict the evolution of the butterfly population in the context of climate change and see - if and how - 
        external factors affect them__.

st.markdown("""
            To do so, I am conducting a Time series analysis with different approaches:
            - __Preprocessing steps__ (varies with each model, but can include): scaling, stationarity, Grange causality test, Cointegration test...
            - __Models__: univariates (SARIMA, Prophet) and multivariates (VAR, Prophet)

            The data used in this project comes from the [UKBMS](https://ukbms.org/index.php/), one of the longest running insect monitoring schemes in 
            the world. I explore 6M butterfly sightings recorded in the UK over the past 20 years. Here is how I approached the dataset to find the 
            model presented in the ðŸ¦‹ Model App page:

            at the city delimitation (temperatures, air quality...), this will have minimal impact on the analysis. The selected sites are found within the
