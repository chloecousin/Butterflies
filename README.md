### 1- __United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS)__

'_One of the longest running insect monitoring schemes in the world. The scheme began in 1976 and now records data on over 2,000 sites per year; incorporating butterfly transects, the Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS), and timed-counts. The resulting UKBMS dataset is one of the most important resources for understanding changes in insect populations_'. For further information, see: https://ukbms.org/
